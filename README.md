This game is called Dungeon Shooter but there is no dungeon yet. Only shooting.

# How to play
Use the keys W, A, S and D to move. The space bar shoots. Try to shoot the pirates before they
reach the bottom of the screen. You gain points by shooting a pirate. You lose points if a pirate
reaches the bottom of the screen. You lose a life if you collide with a pirate. Lose all 3 lives
and your score resets to 0. There is a high score counter.

# How the game was made
We used PyGame. We used ChatGPT to help us write the code you can see that conversation here:

We are using Git-LFS to manage the graphics files. ChatGPT helped with this. You can see that

We used Midjourney to make the graphics files. The prompts used were:

 * a variety of pixel art anime pirates arranged in a grid, nicely spaced out, on a plain background
 * an arrow on a plain background in a 32 bit pixel art style
 * luffy from one piece in a 32 bit pixel art style

Enjoy!
